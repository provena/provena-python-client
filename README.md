# Provena Python Client

Welcome to the Provena Python Client repository! This client library is a programmatic interface designed to interact seamlessly with your Provena instance. The client uses the same Pydantic models as the Provena API, ensuring a one-to-one typed interface with the API. This means that the models used in the client library directly correspond to those used by the API, providing consistency and ease of use. It allows you to replicate most functionalities of the Provena Web app through Python code, including fetching or minting datasets, creating items within the registry, and launching provenance workflows. With the Provena Python Client, you can achieve comprehensive interactions with only a few lines of code.


## Getting Started

To install the Provena Python Client, simply use pip:

```bash
pip install provenaclient
```

Once you have successfully installed provenaclient, refer to the following notebook for examples on how to use the client. Example Notebook here at: [Example Notebook](docs/example-client-workflow.ipynb). 

To find more examples on how to use the client, refer to these collection of notebooks: [Provena Notebook Repository](https://github.com/provena/provena-example-notebooks)


## Testing

If you are interested in running any tests, please make sure to first clone this repository and then follow the below steps: 

### Unit Tests

The Provena Python Client includes unit tests that check functionality using real server interactions and mocked components using `httpx_mock`. Tests cover HTTP methods, error handling, and JSON parsing.

**To run unit tests:**
1. Install dependencies from `pyproject.toml`.
2. Run `pytest test_unit.py` in the test directory.

### Integration Tests

The Provena Python Client includes integration tests that validate and assess the functioning of the client library and its interaction with Provena API's, focusing on dataset operations, entity searching, item fetching, and provenance lifecycle.

**To run integration tests:**
1. Install dependencies from `pyproject.toml`.
2. Set up necessary credentials in `.env` (contact Provena Development Team for setup).
3. Run `pytest test_integration.py` in the test directory.

For detailed testing procedures, see the [Testing Guide](tests/README.md).
