* JIRA 1669 & 1677 Major: Implementing datastore interface & functionality of fetch and create dataset.   (#3)

* Created directory structure.

* Initial structure of everything so far. I have been working on fleshing out the Auth interface as suggested by Peter, and made some progress.

* Completion of Device Flow for Auth Class, and also created a separate. API client that wraps around request library for better testing of auth interface in the future.

* Config Inteface, still needs to be reviewed. Furthermore, a decision needs to be made on how the endpoints are exposed to the user.

Co-authored-by: Ross (Laz) Petridis <Rosspet@users.noreply.github.com>

* Pushing latest changes so Ross can branch off my branch for his offline flow development.

* requirements conflict resolution

* Completed base auth interface + device flow, and provided more type safety to the auth device flow methods.

Completed config interface file with docstrings and updated CI-CD script to only run on main.

* feat(datastore): datastore fetch dataset functionality.

Implemented datastore fetch using the designed layers. Remaning work to design the custom exceptions and require review from others.

* (Still In Progress ): Implementing custom Exceptions for various edge cases when recieving  a response.

* Merging main into datastore-interface branch for easier development.

* Deleted redundant files. Due to file name change  on main there were duplicate files that were not removed during merge.

* (In Progress): Worked on mint dataset and fetch dataset functionality with the client library.

Facing some mypy issues and code needs to be reviewed for further enhancements.

* (FEAT): Completed datastore functionality with fetch and create dataset and also updated CI/CD scripts to push to pypi and made them separated.

* Reverted back to old ci-cd script setup as it would have ran in parallel instead of sequentially.

* Updated ci-cd script to only run on pull requests is  merged with base branch.

* Improved robustness of JSON parsing from response object and created a list of exceptions for better clarity.

* Removed requirements.txt

* Proposed changes and additional functionality (#4)

* Adding some additional poetry help in readme

* Implements streamlined helper functions which are stacked/modular.

Simplifies error parsing in L2.

Applies formatting changes and other minor changes.

* Improving file layout, adding convenience exports on key __init__.py files, moving testing out of import runway etc

* Implementing auth api admin, introducing concept of sub clients and sub modules at L2 and L3 levels

* Making refactor consistently use helper functions and adding documentation to new components/API endpoints

* Adding endpoint gen from open api spec and using for auth APi

* Implementing additional L2 endpoints for auth API
